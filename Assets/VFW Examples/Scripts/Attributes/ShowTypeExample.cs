	/// A demo for ShowTypeAttribute showing how we can overcome the fact that Unity doesn't support
	/// polymorphic serialization for objects (other than UnityEngine.Objects) by having a visible type
	/// object in the inspector to choose the type of our strategy object, and then when our behaviour is created,
	/// we instantiate a strategy based on what type we chose!
	/// ------
	/// UPDATE:
	/// Polymorphic serialization is now supported when using BetterBehaviour so this example is
	/// somewhat obselete - you could just have a TacticStrategy reference and pick an impelemnter (see AbstractsExample.cs)
	/// but I still wanted to demonstrate ShowType usage and that System.Types are serializable...
