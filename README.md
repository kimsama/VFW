# VFW
VFW: Full set of drawers. SaveSystem, Serialize interfaces, generics, auto-props, delegates

VFW is both a runtime and editor extension that offers much more advance features than what comes out of the box with Unity. 
A better drawing API, a faster GUI layout system for editor drawing, a custom serialization system, tons of attributes/drawers, 
helper types and more.
